mwf - normalize?
q. 5 mins doesn't map
patches should have transdermal route, not topical
mucous membrane should trump oral
should puff trigger inhalation route by itself?
"use as directed" as a fallback frequency
q4h-q6h evaluates to q4h
"inhale 1 puff by inhalation route 4 times per day ; may take additional puffs as needed not to exceed 6 puffs in 24hrs" should not map to PRN = 1 - do negative lookbehind?
for indication parser, don't count "take one tablet daily for diabetes" as PRN = 1 - if the PRN segment is just "for", then PRN = 0, but capture the indication
optimize the text to number functions in normalize - had to hard code some fraction stuff

VUMC specific
****
chewable tablets -> tablet


infer frequency from meals
*****
with every meal --> TID
with breakfast --> qd
in the morning --> qd
(copy the when parser and put it at the bottom of the frequency parser)


fix common measurements
*****
tsp -> 5mL, tablespoon -> 15 mL
