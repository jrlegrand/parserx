"in affected" eye, ear, location is not a route
- Update mapping table to "nothing"

Do not map frequency ranges (i.e. Q4-6h)
- Need to exclude Q4H - Q6H pattern


If a time is specified, then use a scheduled frequency with the time in the admin instructions (daily at 10:00 = q24h at 10:00)


WONTFIX
Tab/capsule = oral if indication suggests oral medication
With food is oral
Fractions of tablets are oral
81 mg is aspirin and oral

DONE
"C" in pharmacy shorthand is "capsule"
QPM is "every evening"
Do not infer route (tab/cap by itself does not mean oral)
Application = topical
puff != "inhalation"
Preferred units of measure (mg, units, etc) over count or volume (tablets, mL, etc)


PROPOSED
daily at bedtime == Nightly
test strips / meters / DME / etc = dose/dose unit of 1 each and route of miscellaneous


NOTES
i am not going to map "or" to "oral" because it could also just mean "or"
does "per nostril" really mean each nostril?  or is it more like "via" nostril - in which case we don't know if it's one or both nostrils?
