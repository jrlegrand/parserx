Likely, the first step is migrating the parsers folder to PRD.

Edit the name of the csv file in parserx.io/sig/views.py to be the csv you have been working with locally.
***NOTE: ensure you have converted it to just one column full of sigs with no header.

Touch parserx/parserx.io/tmp/restart.txt to refresh Django.
ssh parserx@ps603466.dreamhostps.com
Password is on LastPass
touch parserx.io/tmp/restart.txt
