  <h3 id="how-we-protect-your-information">How We Protect Your Information</h3>
  <p>
    ParseRx takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal
    information, including by maintaining appropriate administrative, technical,
    and physical safeguards. However, the Internet is by its nature not a secure
    environment, and we cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated
    with sharing your personal information. As such, we do not ensure or warrant
    the security of any data or information you transmit to us. We encourage you
    to always be careful when sharing your information online.
  </p>
  <p>
    ParseRx takes the following measures to protect information in medication
    instructions (sigs) that are collected from users of ParseRx:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All sigs submitted through ParseRx are stored in a database only
      accessible by administrators of the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      ParseRx employees or contractors periodically review the accuracy of
      ParseRx’s parsing of these sigs.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is the responsibility of users of ParseRx to ensure these sigs do not
      contain any personal information.
    </li>
    <li>
      As an added measure, all sigs are reviewed by administrators of ParseRx to
      ensure to the best of our ability that the sigs are free of personal
      information prior to being released to internal ParseRx reviewers for
      review and validation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="california-privacy-rights">California Privacy Rights</h3>
  <p>
    California law permits our customers who are California residents to request
    certain information regarding our disclosure of their personal information
    to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our
    customer’s personal information with unaffiliated third parties for their
    own direct marketing purposes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="do-not-track">Do Not Track</h3>
  <p>
    California law permits our customers who are California residents to be
    informed as to how we respond to Web browser “Do-Not-Track” settings. As
    “Do-Not-Track” is a standard that is currently being developed, we do not
    take actions to respond to “Do-Not-Track” settings or similar mechanisms at
    this time. Instead, we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy
    Policy.
  </p>
  <h5 id="children’s-privacy">Children’s Privacy</h5>
  <p>
    ParseRx is not directed towards children, and we do not knowingly collect
    any personal information from children. If we become aware that we have
    inadvertently received personal information from a user who is under the age
    of fifteen, we will delete that information.
  </p>
  <h3 id="links-to-other-sites">Links to Other Sites</h3>
  <p>
    While using the products services we provide to you, you may find links to
    other websites. These sites may be operated by third party organizations,
    who are not affiliated with ParseRx. We cannot control the content on these
    websites, and we are not responsible for the content, operation, or privacy
    practices of those sites. The privacy and security of the information you
    disclose to these third parties through these third-party sites are governed
    by those organizations’ privacy and security practices and policies. This
    Policy solely governs ParseRx, and does not apply to any outside website or
    service. You may choose to not access these third-party websites, and we
    encourage you to read any privacy notices or policies that may apply to
    those sites.
