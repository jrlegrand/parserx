                            In order to access or use an API, you must first register for and receive an

                            registration process. You must use the API solely for the purpose you state
                            in the application. You are only allowed to register for and use one API
                            Key, unless otherwise permitted by ParseRx in writing. By registering for an
                            API Key, you represent and warrant that you and/or the organization you
                            represent only possess and use one API Key, and that you have not previously
                            had a API Key suspended or terminated by ParseRx. All queries sent to the
                            API requesting ParseRx Content must reference your valid API Key. You agree
                            to keep your API Key confidential and not to share it with any third party.
                            In the event you lose your API Key or learn that it has been used by an
                            unauthorized person or in an unauthorized manner, you must notify ParseRx
                            immediately. ParseRx reserves the right to de-activate any API Keys that it
                            knows or suspects to be lost or used by unauthorized persons, and in such
                            event, ParseRx may, in its sole discretion, provide you with a replacement

                            With the exception of any separate agreements or addendums to the Terms
                            between ParseRx and you, the Terms encompasses the entire agreement between
                            you and ParseRx regarding the subject matter discussed therein. The Terms,
                            and any disputes arising from or relating to the interpretation thereof,
                            will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Tennessee
                            without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to personal
                            jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts of the State of
                            Tennessee, City of Nashville. You also agree that, in the event of a breach
                            of the Terms or your unauthorized use of the API, ParseRx shall be entitled
                            to obtain injunctive relief against you without the necessity of posting a
                            bond. The failure of ParseRx to exercise or enforce any right or provision
                            of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The
                            failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for
                            herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any
                            provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
                            provision will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of
                            the provision that is not enforceable to the minimum extent necessary so
                            that the remaining Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
                            enforceable. The Terms are not assignable, transferable or able to be
                            licensed or sub-licensed, in whole or in part, by you except with ParseRx’s
                            prior written consent. ParseRx may assign the Terms, in whole or in part, at
                            any time with or without notice to you. Any attempt to do so is void. The
                            section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
                            contractual effect.

                            separate action brought for that purpose, in addition to any other relief to
